# 🔖 auth_system_appwrite

A new Flutter project Auth System Mobile App using Flutter with Appwrite.

## 🎬 Getting Started

Appwrite is an end-to-end backend server for Web, Mobile, Native, or Backend apps packaged as a set of Docker microservices. Appwrite abstracts the complexity and repetitiveness required to build a modern backend API from scratch and allows you to build secure apps faster.

### 🤘 Install Appwrite

Follow our simple [Installation Guide](https://appwrite.io/docs/installation) to get Appwrite up and running in no time. You can either deploy Appwrite on your local machine or, on any cloud provider of your choice.

  > Note: If you setup Appwrite on your local machine, you will need to create a public IP 
so that your hosted frontend can access it.

1. We need to make a few configuration changes to your Appwrite server.

    Add a new Flutter App (Android or iOS or both) in Appwrite and enter application id
    of your application (io.appwrite.auth etc)

2. Update ```appwriteConstant.dart``` with your own endpoint and project id.
3. Run ```flutter pub``` get to get the dependencies

### 🚀 Run the Application
